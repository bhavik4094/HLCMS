                    <p className='service-subline'>
                        Berg Bat was founded on one simple idea: Quality. We use the best Maple, Ash, and Birch wood billets, and each bat is carefully turned, hand-sanded, and steel pressed to make sure it’s perfect. Every bat is made to order and customized to the player’s exact preferences. Before any bat leaves the shop, Trevor personally inspects it to make sure it meets our high standards. With more design options and custom finishes than any other brand, Berg Bat is the top choice for your next wood bat.
